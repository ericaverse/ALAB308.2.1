# ALAB 308.2.1: Control Flow

The responsibilities of this assignment are to:

1. Assess the rate of growth of plants, potential overflow, and make recommendations based on the projected development of the plant species.

2. Determine potential space required for a larger set of plants that are allowed to proliferate for an extended period of time.

3. Create and manage "try...catch" error-handling for the program calculating the scientist's decision to grow 100 plants in the 5-meter radius.
